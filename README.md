# UQ
UQ toolkit for APBS

### Uncertainty Quantification
A general UQ framework called Data-driven Sparsity-enhancing Rotation for Arbitrary Randomness (DSRAR) for surrogate model construction has been coupled with APBS. DSRAR does not rely on independence between components of the random inputs and therefore is well-suited for complex systems such as biomolecules where the input distributions can be non-Gaussian or analytically unknown.

To perform a UQ analysis using APBS, the code can be downloaded from the APBS server: [APBS-UQ](./UQ)
